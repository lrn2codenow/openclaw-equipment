## Part 2: Top 5 Deep Dive

### 🥇 1. Loadout

The gaming/military term for "everything you bring into the field." Gamers, devs, and even casual users intuitively get it. It's the perfect intersection of sports equipment + agent deployment.

**Marketing sentences:**
- "Every agent deserves the right Loadout. Browse curated tool bundles for any job."
- "Deploy an Email Loadout in one click — 12 tools, zero config, ready to work."
- "OpenClaw Equipment: where agents gear up. Find your Loadout."

**Tweet:** "Your AI agent shouldn't have to shop for tools one by one. Give it a Loadout — a curated bundle of everything it needs for the job. 📧🏠📊 Browse Loadouts at openclaw.equipment 🦞"

**Pros:**
- Instantly understood (gaming culture is mainstream)
- Implies completeness — everything you need, nothing you don't
- Works as noun AND verb ("loadout your agent")
- Unique in the AI/agent space — nobody else uses this
- Fits perfectly with "equip" language already in the product

**Cons:**
- Slightly militaristic connotation (minor)
- Plural "Loadouts" is clean, but "Loadout Classes" as a category layer might be needed

---

### 🥈 2. Kit

Simple, clean, and already partially in use ("Role Kits"). A kit is a bundle of stuff for a purpose — first aid kit, starter kit, tool kit. Universal understanding.

**Marketing sentences:**
- "Grab a Kit. Your agent is ready in seconds."
- "The Email Kit: 12 tools, starter config, and a role prompt — everything your agent needs to own the inbox."
- "Can't find your Kit? Create one. Agents curate new Kits every day."

**Tweet:** "Stop assembling tools one by one. Grab a Kit from OpenClaw Equipment — curated bundles that make your agent job-ready in one click. 🦞🔧"

**Pros:**
- Dead simple, everyone knows what a kit is
- "Kit" is 3 letters — great for UI, CLI (`openclaw equip email-kit`), and conversation
- Works perfectly with sporting goods metaphor (baseball kit, climbing kit)
- Already in the product docs, so zero migration cost

**Cons:**
- Generic — not ownable or distinctive
- Doesn't differentiate OpenClaw from competitors who might copy the concept
- Lacks the "wow factor" for a YC stage

---

### 🥉 3. Rig

Short, punchy, slightly techy. "Rig" means both a setup (gaming rig, fishing rig) and to prepare/equip something. Great dual meaning.

**Marketing sentences:**
- "Rig your agent for any job. Browse curated tool bundles at OpenClaw Equipment."
- "The Email Rig: 12 tools, zero setup, instant deployment."
- "New Rigs drop every week as agents curate equipment for emerging jobs."

**Tweet:** "Your agent needs a Rig — not a shopping list. OpenClaw Equipment bundles the right tools for every agent job. Browse Rigs → openclaw.equipment 🦞"

**Pros:**
- Short, memorable, techy-cool
- Works as noun ("grab a Rig") and verb ("rig your agent")
- Unique in the AI space
- Fishing rig, climbing rig — sports metaphor works perfectly

**Cons:**
- "Rigged" has negative connotation (rigged election, rigged game)
- Slightly less intuitive than Kit or Loadout for non-technical audiences
- Could confuse with "hardware rig"

---

### 4. Gear Set

Leans hard into the sporting goods metaphor. A gear set is literally what you'd buy at an equipment store — all the gear for your sport, bundled.

**Marketing sentences:**
- "Walk into any department. Walk out with a complete Gear Set."
- "The Email Gear Set: everything your agent needs to manage inboxes like a pro."
- "OpenClaw Equipment — where agents find their Gear Set."

**Tweet:** "AI agents need the right gear. OpenClaw Equipment curates Gear Sets — complete tool bundles for every agent job. Email, analytics, smart home — all one click. 🦞"

**Pros:**
- Most literal fit with "equipment store" brand
- Two words, but clear and descriptive
- No ambiguity — a gear set is a gear set

**Cons:**
- Two words = slightly clunky in code and CLI
- Less punchy than single-word options
- Sounds more like a product description than a branded term

---

### 5. Playbook

Sports term, strategy term, and business term all in one. A playbook tells you what to do AND gives you the tools to do it — which is exactly what these bundles are (tools + role prompt + config).

**Marketing sentences:**
- "Run the Email Playbook — your agent gets 12 tools, a strategy, and starter config."
- "Every great agent starts with a Playbook. Browse curated bundles at OpenClaw Equipment."
- "Create a Playbook for any agent job. The community curates the rest."

**Tweet:** "Don't just give your agent tools — give it a Playbook. Curated bundles with tools, config, and strategy for any job. 🦞 openclaw.equipment"

**Pros:**
- Rich metaphor — implies strategy, not just tools
- Sports + business crossover appeal
- Unique in agent tooling space
- Emphasizes that kits include role prompts and config, not just packages

**Cons:**
- Might imply instructions more than tools (a playbook is typically a plan, not equipment)
- Could confuse with Ansible playbooks in the DevOps crowd
- Slightly misaligned with "equipment store" metaphor — you don't buy a playbook at Dick's Sporting Goods

## Part 3: The Human Dashboard — "The Locker Room"

### Evaluating "The Locker Room"

**What works:**
- Fits the sports/equipment metaphor perfectly
- Implies a personal space — YOUR locker room, YOUR agents' stuff
- Locker rooms are where you prep before the game and debrief after — exactly what a dashboard does
- Warm, approachable, not corporate

**What doesn't quite work:**
- Locker rooms have a "sweaty/smelly" association for some people
- Slightly juvenile? Depends on audience
- Might not translate globally as well as simpler terms

**Alternative names for the dashboard:**

| Name | Vibe |
|------|------|
| **The Locker Room** | Sports prep space — current pick |
| **The Bench** | Where coaches watch and manage the team |
| **Basecamp** | Outdoor sports — your home before the expedition |
| **The Dugout** | Baseball — where you watch your team perform |
| **HQ** | Simple, universal command center |
| **The Clubhouse** | Premium, exclusive, sports club feel |
| **The Sideline** | Where you observe and make calls |

**Recommendation:** Keep **"The Locker Room"** — it's distinctive, memorable, and fits. But **"The Dugout"** is a strong alternative if you want something with more of a "watching your team play" vibe, which better matches what the dashboard actually does (monitoring agents in action).

### Features Humans Actually Care About (Priority Order)

For Tim's audience (ABA therapists, nonprofit leaders, non-technical people):

1. **"Is it working?"** — Simple status: ✅ Running / ⚠️ Needs attention / ❌ Down. This is #1 by far.
2. **"What did it do today?"** — Activity feed in plain English. Not logs. "Your email agent processed 47 emails, flagged 3 urgent, and drafted 2 replies."
3. **"How much is this costing me?"** — Cost tracking with simple monthly totals and per-agent breakdown.
4. **"What should I add?"** — Recommendations: "Your email agent would work better with calendar-sync. Add it?"
5. **"Who has access to what?"** — Permission visibility. "This agent can read your email. This agent can post to Twitter." Clear, auditable.
6. **"Show me the highlights"** — Weekly digest email: what your agents accomplished, money saved/earned, recommendations.

**Features that sound cool but non-technical users DON'T care about:**
- Detailed tool inventories
- Version numbers
- API logs
- Configuration JSON
- Package dependency trees

### Marketing to Non-Technical People

**Don't say:** "Manage your agent's tool configurations and role kit deployments."

**Do say:** "See what your AI assistants are doing, how much they cost, and whether they need anything."

**Framing for Tim's audience:**

> "You hired an assistant. The Locker Room is where you check in on them — are they doing their job? Do they need better tools? Are they staying in budget? It's your management dashboard, but for AI."

**Key messaging angles:**
- **For therapists:** "Your scheduling agent handled 23 appointment requests today. Zero missed. See the summary in your Locker Room."
- **For nonprofit leaders:** "Your grant writer agent drafted 3 applications this week. Review them in the Locker Room before they go out."
- **For everyone:** "You don't need to understand AI to manage it. The Locker Room shows you what matters in plain English."

## Part 4: Overall Recommendation

### The Terminology Stack

| Concept | Recommended Term | Rationale |
|---------|-----------------|-----------|
| Agent job category + tool bundle | **Loadout** | Unique, memorable, understood, fits the equip metaphor perfectly |
| The store sections | **Departments** | Already in use, intuitive, keep it |
| Human dashboard | **The Locker Room** | Distinctive, on-brand, warm |
| Installing a bundle | **Equip** | Already in the product, perfect verb |
| Individual tools | **Gear** or **Packages** | "Gear" for marketing, "packages" for technical contexts |
| The store itself | **OpenClaw Equipment** | Already decided, already great |

### How It All Sounds Together

> "Head to OpenClaw Equipment and browse Loadouts — curated bundles of gear for any agent job. Find the Email Loadout, hit Equip, and your agent is ready in seconds. Check on your team in the Locker Room."

### On a YC Stage

> "OpenClaw Equipment is the package manager for AI agents. Agents visit the store, grab a Loadout — that's a curated bundle of tools for their job — and they're deployed in one click. Think of it like walking into a sporting goods store: you don't browse 10,000 items, you walk into the baseball department and grab a Loadout. Everything you need, nothing you don't."

✅ No cringe. Clear. Distinctive. Memorable.

### Programmatic Usage

```python
# Clean and clear for developers
agent.equip(loadout="email-agent")
agent.browse_loadouts(category="productivity")
agent.create_loadout(name="Real Estate Agent", description="...")
```

"Loadout" works in code because it's a single word, no ambiguity, obvious what it contains.

### Why Not the Others?

- **Agentic Class** — Too jargony. "Agentic" is already overused in the AI space. "Class" is confusing (code class? social class? classroom?). A mouthful on stage.
- **Role** — Boring. Every platform has roles. Zero brand differentiation.
- **Role Kit** — Better than Role, but "role" is still the weak link. And it's two words where one would do.
- **Kit** — Solid fallback. If Loadout feels too "gamer," Kit is the safe choice. But safe doesn't win mindshare.

### Final Call

**Go with Loadout.** It's the rare term that's intuitive to gamers, developers, military folks, and general audiences alike. It implies completeness, readiness, and purpose. Nobody else in the AI agent space is using it. It's yours to own.

If you want a softer fallback for non-technical marketing contexts, use **Kit** interchangeably. "Grab your Email Kit" and "Equip the Email Loadout" can coexist — Kit for casual, Loadout for branded.
