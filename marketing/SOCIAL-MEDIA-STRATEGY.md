# OpenClaw Equipment — Social Media Strategy

---

## Channels to Secure

### Priority 1 — Secure Immediately

| Platform | Handle Recommendation | Purpose |
|----------|----------------------|---------|
| **Twitter/X** | `@OpenClawEquip` (primary) or `@ClawEquip` | Launch announcements, dev engagement, memes |
| **GitHub** | `lrn2codenow/openclaw-equipment` (exists) | Source code, issues, community PRs |
| **Discord** | "OpenClaw" server with `#equipment` channel | Community hub, support, showcase |
| **Bluesky** | `@openclaw-equipment.bsky.social` | Dev community (growing fast in 2026) |

### Priority 2 — Secure Within 2 Weeks

| Platform | Handle Recommendation | Purpose |
|----------|----------------------|---------|
| **Reddit** | Participate in r/artificial, r/LocalLLaMA, r/MCP, r/selfhosted | Launch posts, community engagement |
| **YouTube** | "OpenClaw Equipment" channel | Tutorials, demos, deep dives |
| **LinkedIn** | "OpenClaw Equipment" company page | B2B outreach, enterprise visibility |
| **Mastodon** | `@openclawequip@fosstodon.org` | FOSS community presence |
| **Dev.to** | `openclawequip` | Technical articles |

### Handle Naming Convention

**Primary:** `OpenClawEquip` (fits most character limits, clear, professional)
**Fallback:** `ClawEquip` or `OCEquipment`
**Never:** `lobster_tools`, `claw_pkg_mgr`, or anything that doesn't include "equip"

## Content Pillars

Everything we post falls into one of five pillars:

### 1. 🛠️ **Builder Content** (40% of posts)
Technical tutorials, code snippets, integration guides, "how to publish a package", WebMCP explainers. This is our bread and butter — useful content that developers bookmark and share.

### 2. 📦 **Package Spotlight** (20% of posts)
"Package of the Week" features, new package announcements, publisher spotlights, "Top 10 packages for X" lists. Drives discovery and rewards contributors.

### 3. 🦞 **Brand & Culture** (15% of posts)
Lobster memes (tasteful), behind-the-scenes, team updates, milestone celebrations, open-source philosophy posts. Builds personality and memorability.

### 4. 🌊 **Ecosystem & Industry** (15% of posts)
MCP news, WebMCP standard updates, agent framework developments, AI tooling trends. Positions us as a thought leader, not just a product.

### 5. 👥 **Community** (10% of posts)
User showcases, contributor shoutouts, poll questions, "what should we build next?", hackathon announcements. Drives engagement and belonging.

## Engagement Strategy

### Reply Policy
- **Reply to every comment** in the first 30 days. Every. Single. One.
- After 30 days: reply to all questions, most positive comments, thoughtful criticism
- Never engage trolls. Mute and move on.

### Engagement Tactics

1. **Quote-tweet interesting agent/MCP projects** with "This would make a great Equipment package 🦞" — drives awareness and invites publishers
2. **"Did you know?"** series — short facts about WebMCP, P2P distribution, agent tooling
3. **Polls** — "What tools does your agent need most?" drives engagement and product insight
4. **Celebrate milestones publicly** — "100 packages!", "First 1,000 installs!", "Someone in Japan just installed via P2P!"
5. **Respond to competitor announcements** graciously — "Cool to see PulseMCP growing! More tools in the ecosystem = better for everyone. We're focused on making those tools *installable*. 🦞"

### Hashtag Strategy

**Own:** `#OpenClawEquip` `#EquipYourAgent` `#ClawTools`
**Ride:** `#MCP` `#AIAgents` `#WebMCP` `#AITooling` `#BuildWithAI` `#OpenSource`
