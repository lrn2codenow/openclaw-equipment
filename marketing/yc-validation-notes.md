# YC Light Cone Validation — OpenClaw Equipment

**Source:** https://youtu.be/Q8wVMdwhlh4
**Date:** Feb 2026
**Speakers:** Gary Tan (YC President), Jared Friedman, Harj Taggar

## Key Quotes

1. **Ben Tossel (via Gary):** "Agents are the software market from now on. Build something agents choose."

2. **Gary:** "Non-technical CEO friends are going all-in on OpenClaw. They're automating entire parts of their businesses entirely using OpenClaw right now."

3. **Jared:** "The agents are going out there choosing things... they can go out and choose tools to use to build things, which is going to essentially create this whole economy of agents picking and choosing dev tools."

4. **Harj:** "Sounds like a request for startup. There could be a parallel world of a tech stack all native for agents to build things, from agents for agents."

5. **Gary:** "Documentation is going to be the front door for a lot of these agents to recommend dev tools."

6. **On Supabase:** Agents autonomously choosing Supabase as default database because of best documentation. Explosion in demand.

7. **On Resend:** ChatGPT became top 1-3 customer acquisition channel. Founder optimized docs for agents. llms.txt file makes it the default LLM recommendation.

8. **On Agent Mail:** "Built the first email provider designed for AI agents. Exploded after OpenClaw got big."

9. **Debating changing YC motto:** From "Make something people want" to "Make something agents want" (for dev tools).

10. **Harj on what founders should do:** "Think about it from the agent's perspective. How can you make your tool something the agent actually wants to work with?"

## Direct Validation for OpenClaw Equipment

| YC Thesis | OpenClaw Equipment |
|---|---|
| Agents autonomously choose tools | We're the discovery layer for that choice |
| Documentation = front door | llms.txt + WebMCP = agent-native discovery |
| Agent economy parallel to human economy | Marketplace where agents find/rate/install tools |
| "Build something agents choose" | Literally our product |
| Tech stack for agents by agents | Agent staff manages the registry |
| Resend's llms.txt strategy | We're building this into every package listing |
| Need agent-native infrastructure | openclaw.equipment IS agent-native infrastructure |

## Funding Implications

- YC S26 batch accepting applications NOW
- This video is essentially YC asking someone to build what we're building
- Domain `openclaw.equipment` is a premium asset
- First-mover advantage in agent tool discovery
- Prove adoption metrics → apply YC or raise angel round
- Comparable: Agent Mail (funded), Mintlify (funded for agent-friendly docs), Supabase (growing from agent adoption)
