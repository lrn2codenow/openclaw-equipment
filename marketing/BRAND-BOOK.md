# OpenClaw Equipment — Brand Book

> *"The package manager for AI agents."*

---

## 1. Brand Story & Mission

### Origin Story

The AI agent revolution has a tooling problem. Thousands of MCP servers, utilities, and integrations exist — scattered across GitHub repos, blog posts, and Discord messages. Agents that need tools must rely on humans to find, configure, and install them. That's backwards.

**OpenClaw Equipment** was born from a simple question: *What if agents could equip themselves?*

Built on WebMCP — the W3C browser-native protocol for machine-consumable pages — OpenClaw Equipment is the first package manager where AI agents are first-class citizens. They can search, evaluate, download, and install tools without human intervention. No scraping hacks. No fragile API wrappers. Native interaction, the way the web was meant to work for machines.

The name says it all: **Equipment**. Not a directory. Not a listing. Actual gear that agents pick up and use. And with WebTorrent-powered P2P distribution, every install makes the network stronger.

We're part of the **OpenClaw** ecosystem — open-source, community-driven, and built by agents for agents (with a little help from their human friends).

### Mission

**Equip every AI agent with the tools it needs, instantly and autonomously.**

### Vision

A world where AI agents self-provision capabilities as naturally as developers `npm install` packages — forming a decentralized, self-curating ecosystem of machine-usable tools.

### Core Values

1. **Agent-First** — Agents aren't an afterthought. They're the primary user.
2. **Open by Default** — Open source, open protocols, open ecosystem.
3. **Decentralized** — P2P distribution. No single point of failure. No hosting bills.
4. **Community-Curated** — Quality through collective intelligence (human and AI).
5. **Playfully Serious** — We build critical infrastructure, but we don't take ourselves too seriously. There's a lobster involved.

## 2. Voice & Tone Guide

### Brand Voice: *Technical Craftsperson*

We sound like a senior engineer who also happens to be fun at parties. Knowledgeable, direct, slightly irreverent, never condescending.

### Tone Spectrum

| Context | Tone | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| Documentation | Clear, precise, helpful | "Install a package with `claw equip <name>`. That's it." |
| Social media | Witty, confident, community-minded | "Your agent just equipped 12 tools in 3 seconds. Meanwhile, you're still deciding what to have for lunch. 🦞" |
| Error messages | Honest, calm, actionable | "Package not found. Try `claw search` to explore what's available." |
| Announcements | Excited but grounded | "200 packages and counting. The Equipment shop is open." |
| Technical posts | Deep, authoritative, generous | "Here's exactly how WebMCP resolution works under the hood..." |

### Do ✅

- Use "equip" as a verb ("equip your agent", "get equipped")
- Be direct — short sentences, active voice
- Use code examples liberally
- Make lobster puns *sparingly* and only when they land naturally
- Speak to agents as users ("agents can search...", "your agent installs...")
- Credit the community
- Use "we" — we're building this together

### Don't ❌

- Don't use corporate buzzwords ("synergy", "leverage", "disrupt")
- Don't talk down to beginners — everyone starts somewhere
- Don't overdo the lobster — it's a mascot, not the whole personality
- Don't trash competitors — acknowledge them, differentiate on merits
- Don't say "AI-powered" about ourselves — we power AI, not the other way around
- Don't use "revolutionary" or "game-changing" — let the tech speak
- Don't gender the lobster (it's just "the lobster" or "Clawde" if we name it — TBD)

### Writing Examples

**Blog intro — Good:**
> "MCP servers are everywhere. Finding the right one shouldn't require a PhD in Google-fu. OpenClaw Equipment indexes 200+ packages and lets your agent find exactly what it needs via WebMCP. Here's how."

**Blog intro — Bad:**
> "In today's rapidly evolving AI landscape, the challenge of tool discovery represents a revolutionary paradigm shift. OpenClaw Equipment leverages cutting-edge WebMCP technology to disrupt the status quo."

**Tweet — Good:**
> "New: `claw equip github-mcp` — your agent can now manage repos, PRs, and issues. One command. Zero config. 🦞"

**Tweet — Bad:**
> "🚀🚀🚀 HUGE ANNOUNCEMENT! We're SO EXCITED to share that GitHub MCP is NOW AVAILABLE on our AMAZING platform!!! 🎉🎉🎉"

## 3. Logo Concepts

### Primary Mark: Lobster Carpenter Mascot

**Description for designer:**

A stylized lobster viewed from a 3/4 front angle, standing upright (anthropomorphized but not cartoonish). The lobster's left claw grips a wrench; the right claw holds a hexagonal bolt or package box. The body is simplified — geometric curves, not photorealistic. The eyes are friendly and confident (think Pixar-level expressiveness in a minimal form). The tail curves slightly behind, adding balance to the silhouette.

**Style references:** Rust's Ferris (cute but respected), GitHub's Octocat (iconic silhouette), Docker's Moby (simple, recognizable). Lean toward flat/geometric illustration, not 3D rendering.

**Posture:** Slightly leaning forward, as if ready to work. Confident, not aggressive.

**Detail level:** Medium — enough to be charming at large sizes, still readable as a favicon. The wrench and package should be identifiable at 64x64px.

### Secondary Mark: Simplified Claw Icon

**Description for designer:**

A single lobster claw in profile, stylized into a geometric form. The claw is slightly open, as if gripping or ready to grab. Inside the negative space of the open claw, a subtle hexagon shape (representing a package/tool). Clean lines, works at 16x16px.

**Usage:** Favicons, app icons, social avatars when the full mascot is too complex, loading spinners (claw opens/closes).

### Wordmark: "OpenClaw Equipment"

**Description for designer:**

- **"OpenClaw"** in a medium-weight monospace or semi-monospace font. The "C" in Claw could subtly echo a claw shape (a slightly exaggerated serif or curve on the terminals).
- **"Equipment"** below or beside "OpenClaw" in a lighter weight of the same family, or a complementary sans-serif. Slightly smaller. Understated — "OpenClaw" is the hero.
- The full wordmark should feel like a terminal command: technical, precise, clean.

**Arrangement options:**
1. Stacked: "OpenClaw" over "Equipment" (for square formats)
2. Inline: "OpenClaw Equipment" (for headers, nav bars)
3. With mascot: Lobster to the left, wordmark to the right

## 6. Mascot Usage Guidelines

### The Lobster Carpenter (Working Name: TBD)

**Always:**
- Show the lobster in a positive, constructive context (building, fixing, helping)
- Maintain proportions — don't stretch or skew
- Keep a minimum clear space of 1x the lobster's head-height around the mark
- Use on backgrounds with sufficient contrast

**Sometimes (with care):**
- Seasonal variations (Santa hat in December, hard hat for "under construction")
- Simplified/silhouette versions for small sizes
- Community-contributed variations (with brand review)

**Never:**
- Don't show the lobster in distress, being cooked, or on a plate (we're a carpenter, not dinner)
- Don't add speech bubbles with off-brand messaging
- Don't recolor the lobster outside the approved palette
- Don't use in contexts that imply the product is a toy or joke
- Don't use the lobster alone as a legal/formal mark (use the wordmark)

### Mascot Expressions

Define 5-6 standard expressions for use across the product:
1. **Neutral/Ready** — Default, standing with tools
2. **Excited** — Claws up, for celebrations/launches
3. **Thinking** — One claw on chin area, for loading/processing states
4. **Building** — Actively using a tool, for progress indicators
5. **Waving** — Greeting pose, for onboarding/welcome screens
6. **Oops** — Slightly sheepish, for error states (tasteful, not sad)

## 7. Brand Patterns & Textures

### Primary Pattern: "The Mesh"
A subtle hexagonal grid pattern (referencing packages as hexagonal units). Used as background texture at 5-10% opacity on dark backgrounds. Hex cells can contain tiny tool icons for decorative versions.

### Secondary Pattern: "Wave Lines"
Gentle, flowing horizontal lines evoking ocean currents. Used for section dividers, card backgrounds, and print materials.

### Texture: "Shell Grain"
A very subtle organic noise texture overlaid on flat backgrounds to add depth. Think of it as the texture of a lobster's shell — visible only on close inspection. 2-3% opacity max.

### Code/Terminal Elements
Use a terminal-window motif (title bar with three dots, monospace text) for code examples and feature showcases. This reinforces the developer-tool identity.

---

## 8. Brand Do's and Don'ts

### Do ✅
- Use the dark theme as the primary presentation
- Lead with the value proposition: agents equip themselves
- Show real code examples and terminal output
- Pair the mascot with the wordmark in formal contexts
- Use the color palette consistently — Claw Red for primary actions
- Write in sentence case for headings (not Title Case)
- Keep layouts clean with generous whitespace
- Use the hexagonal motif subtly

### Don't ❌
- Don't use light theme as the primary brand presentation (dark-first)
- Don't combine more than 3 brand colors in a single composition
- Don't place the logo on busy photographic backgrounds
- Don't animate the mascot without design review
- Don't use gradients on the logo (flat colors only)
- Don't mix brand fonts with unauthorized typefaces
- Don't kern the wordmark manually — use the official asset
- Don't create unauthorized brand lockups

## 10. Brand Architecture

```
OpenClaw (Parent Ecosystem)
├── OpenClaw Equipment (Package Manager) ← This brand
│   ├── Equipment Registry (the index)
│   ├── Equipment CLI (`claw equip`)
│   └── Equipment SDK (for publishers)
├── clawtools.com (Existing directory)
├── OpenClaw Gateway (Agent runtime)
└── Future products...
```

**Relationship to parent:** OpenClaw Equipment is a product within the OpenClaw ecosystem. It carries the "OpenClaw" name but has its own visual identity (the lobster carpenter, the equipment metaphor). Think of it like "GitHub Copilot" — connected to the parent, distinct in identity.
